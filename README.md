# Automated Amazon Web Scraper
In this project, I scraped data from an amazon website, cleaned the data and created a pandas data frame out of the data. I also converted the data into CSV and automated the process to run every 24 hours to track price changes of the product on the website. If thereâ€™s a price change below $15, I receive an email about the price change.
